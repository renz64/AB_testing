This is a statistical analysis project that I have done as part of the Data Analyst nanodegree program in Udacity. I have used Python and the associated libraries including pandas, numpy, statsmodels and matplotlib. I have performed data wrangling, statistical analysis, A/B testing and unsupervised learning (regression analysis) to check if a new web page design induced more people to subscribe to the page (convert).
